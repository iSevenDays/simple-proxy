# PRD: Harmony Format Parsing Fixes

## Executive Summary

Fix critical issues in Simple Proxy's Harmony format parsing where content extraction from channels (specifically `final` channel) fails, resulting in raw Harmony tokens being displayed in Claude Code UI instead of clean, formatted content. This addresses user experience degradation where properly formatted markdown responses appear as unformatted, continuous text with visible structural tokens.

## Problem Statement

### Current Issues
1. **Content Extraction Failure**: Harmony parser fails to properly extract content from `<|channel|>final<|message|>` sections
2. **Raw Token Display**: Users see raw Harmony structural tokens (`<|start|>`, `<|channel|>`, `<|message|>`, `<|return|>`) in Claude Code UI
3. **Format Degradation**: Well-structured markdown with newlines and formatting appears as continuous, unformatted text
4. **Inconsistent Behavior**: Parser works correctly for some formats but fails for proper OpenAI Harmony specification

### Root Cause Analysis
- Harmony parsing logic in `proxy/transform.go` doesn't correctly handle the full OpenAI Harmony message format
- Content extraction focuses on simplified patterns rather than full Harmony specification
- Channel separation logic fails to identify and extract clean content from `final` channel
- Fallback mechanisms inadequate when Harmony parsing partially succeeds but content extraction fails

### Impact
- **User Experience**: Degraded readability with visible structural tokens
- **Content Quality**: Loss of formatting and structure in responses
- **Developer Productivity**: Harder to read and understand AI responses in Claude Code UI
- **System Reliability**: Inconsistent behavior across different Harmony format variations

## User Stories

### Primary User Personas
1. **Claude Code Users**: Developers using Claude Code CLI for assistance
2. **System Integrators**: Users connecting Claude Code through Simple Proxy to various LLM providers

### User Journeys

#### Story 1: Developer Receives Formatted Response
**As a** Claude Code user  
**I want** to receive properly formatted responses with preserved newlines and markdown  
**So that** I can easily read and understand AI-generated content  

**Current Experience:**
- User asks: "Present me with your two best ideas to solve duplication issue"
- Receives: `<|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>**Solution A** Add a private method...` (raw tokens visible)
- Result: Confused, hard-to-read response

**Desired Experience:**
- User asks: "Present me with your two best ideas to solve duplication issue"
- Receives: Clean markdown with proper formatting and newlines
- Result: Easy to read, well-structured response

#### Story 2: System Administrator Troubleshoots Issues
**As a** system administrator  
**I want** consistent Harmony parsing behavior  
**So that** I can reliably predict and debug content formatting issues  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] All Harmony format variations are handled consistently
- [ ] Clear error logging when parsing fails
- [ ] Graceful fallback to non-Harmony parsing when Harmony tokens malformed

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

#### FR1: Proper Harmony Channel Parsing
- **Must** correctly parse OpenAI Harmony format: `<|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>{content}<|return|>`
- **Must** extract clean content from `final` channel without structural tokens
- **Must** preserve all newlines, formatting, and whitespace in extracted content
- **Must** handle both `<|return|>` and `<|end|>` termination tokens

#### FR2: Multi-Channel Support
- **Must** distinguish between `analysis`, `commentary`, and `final` channels
- **Must** extract content from appropriate channels based on configuration
- **Should** support channel-specific processing rules

#### FR3: Robust Fallback Mechanisms
- **Must** gracefully handle malformed Harmony content
- **Must** fallback to non-Harmony parsing when Harmony parsing fails
- **Must** preserve original content when extraction fails rather than showing partial tokens

#### FR4: Content Integrity
- **Must** preserve exact character sequences including newlines, tabs, and spacing
- **Must** maintain markdown formatting structure
- **Must** handle Unicode characters correctly

### Non-Functional Requirements

#### NFR1: Performance
- **Must** add minimal latency to response processing (<10ms overhead)
- **Should** fail fast on malformed content rather than attempting expensive parsing

#### NFR2: Reliability
- **Must** handle all Harmony format edge cases without crashes
- **Must** maintain backward compatibility with existing non-Harmony content
- **Should** provide detailed error logging for debugging

#### NFR3: Maintainability
- **Must** use testable, modular parsing functions
- **Should** follow existing codebase patterns and conventions
- **Should** include comprehensive unit test coverage

## Success Criteria

### Measurable Outcomes
1. **Parsing Accuracy**: 100% correct content extraction for valid Harmony formats
2. **Format Preservation**: 0% content formatting loss (newlines, markdown structure)
3. **Error Handling**: 100% graceful failure handling without system crashes
4. **User Experience**: Elimination of visible structural tokens in Claude Code UI

### Key Metrics and KPIs
- **Test Coverage**: â‰¥95% coverage for Harmony parsing functions
- **Regression Tests**: All existing functionality remains unaffected
- **Performance Impact**: <1% increase in response processing time
- **Error Rate**: <0.1% parsing failures on valid Harmony content

## Technical Implementation Details

### Core Changes Required

#### 1. Enhanced Harmony Pattern Recognition
```go
// Improved pattern matching for full Harmony format
harmonyPattern := `<\|start\|>assistant<\|channel\|>(analysis|commentary|final)<\|message\|>(.*?)<\|(return|end)\|>`
```

#### 2. Channel-Specific Content Extraction
- Parse multiple channels in single response
- Extract content from appropriate channel based on priority
- Handle mixed channel responses

#### 3. Content Cleaning Pipeline
- Strip all Harmony structural tokens
- Preserve content formatting and whitespace
- Validate content integrity

### Test Coverage Requirements
- **Unit Tests**: All parsing functions with edge cases
- **Integration Tests**: Full request/response cycle with Harmony content
- **Regression Tests**: Ensure non-Harmony content unaffected
- **Performance Tests**: Response time impact measurement

## Constraints & Assumptions

### Technical Constraints
- **Backward Compatibility**: Must not break existing non-Harmony parsing
- **Performance**: Cannot significantly impact response latency
- **Memory**: Parsing must not consume excessive memory for large responses

### Timeline Constraints
- **Critical Fix**: High priority due to user experience impact
- **Quick Resolution**: Should be implementable within existing architecture

### Resource Constraints
- **Development**: Single developer implementation
