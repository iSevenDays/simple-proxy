# Task: Integrate Harmony Parser into Transformation Pipeline

## Description
Integrate the Harmony parser into the existing `proxy/transform.go` transformation pipeline as a pre-processing step. This enables automatic detection and transformation of Harmony format messages while preserving all existing functionality and tool/system overrides.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Harmony detection added to `proxy/transform.go` transformation flow
- [ ] Parser integration follows chain-of-responsibility pattern (Harmony â†’ fallback)
- [ ] Thinking content properly extracted and stored in response metadata
- [ ] Final channel content becomes main response content
- [ ] Commentary channel content handled appropriately
- [ ] All existing tool and system override functionality preserved
- [ ] Streaming response support maintained
- [ ] Feature flag controlled integration
- [ ] Integration tests verify end-to-end functionality

## Technical Details
- **Implementation approach**: Add pre-processing step in transform pipeline
- **Key considerations**: 
  - Must not break existing transformation logic
  - Chain of responsibility: attempt Harmony parsing first, fallback to existing
  - Preserve streaming compatibility
  - Feature flag controls whether Harmony parsing is attempted
- **Code locations**: Modify `proxy/transform.go`
- **Integration points**:
  - Add Harmony detection before existing transformation
  - Integrate with response type enhancements from Task 002
  - Preserve all existing override functionality

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 001: Core parser implementation
- [ ] Task 002: Response type enhancements
- [ ] Existing transformation pipeline in `proxy/transform.go`

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 20-24 hours
- Parallel: false (depends on parser and types)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code integrated into transformation pipeline
- [ ] Integration tests written and passing
- [ ] Streaming functionality verified
- [ ] Feature flag integration working
- [ ] No regression in existing functionality
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meet targets
