# Stream B: Token Recognition Engine

## Scope
Implement regex-based token recognition for <|start|>, <|channel|>, <|message|>, <|end|> patterns with compiled patterns for performance.

## Files
- parser/harmony.go (regex patterns and token parsing functions)

## Dependencies
- ✅ Stream A (types) - COMPLETED

## Progress
- ✅ Stream A types are ready
- ✅ Token recognition engine implementation completed
- ✅ Core functions implemented:
  - `IsHarmonyFormat(content string) bool` - Quick detection of Harmony tokens
  - `ExtractChannels(content string) []Channel` - Extract and parse individual channels
  - Token parsing helper functions with compiled regex patterns
  - Streaming response support for incomplete tokens
  - Graceful error handling for malformed tokens
- ✅ Additional utility functions:
  - `FindHarmonyTokens()` - Token position analysis
  - `ValidateHarmonyStructure()` - Structure validation
  - `GetHarmonyTokenStats()` - Performance monitoring
- ✅ Performance optimized with compiled regex patterns
- ✅ Tested with PRD examples - all working correctly

## Implementation Details
- Used package-level `defaultTokenRecognizer` for performance
- Implemented multiline content support with `(?s)` flag
- Graceful handling of malformed and streaming content
- Support for both complete messages and partial tokens
- Comprehensive error handling with custom HarmonyParseError types
