# Stream A: Anthropic Response Extension

## Scope
Extend AnthropicResponse with optional thinking metadata fields while maintaining backward compatibility.

## Files
- types/anthropic.go

## Dependencies
- ✅ Issue #2 (Harmony Parser) - COMPLETED

## Progress
- ✅ Added parser package import to types/anthropic.go
- ✅ Extended AnthropicResponse struct with optional ThinkingContent field (*string with omitempty)
- ✅ Extended AnthropicResponse struct with optional HarmonyChannels field ([]parser.Channel with omitempty)
- ✅ Implemented HasThinking() helper method to check for thinking content presence
- ✅ Implemented GetThinkingText() helper method to safely retrieve thinking content
- ✅ Verified backward compatibility - all new fields are optional with omitempty tags
- ✅ Fixed import paths for both anthropic.go and openai.go (corrected module name)
- ✅ Verified build passes successfully

## Completed Work
All requirements for Stream A have been implemented:
- AnthropicResponse extended with thinking metadata fields
- Proper integration with parser.Channel types
- Helper methods for convenient access to thinking content
- Backward compatibility maintained through optional fields
- Clean build verification completed
