# Stream B: OpenAI Response Extension

## Scope
Extend OpenAI response structures with thinking metadata for mixed-channel messages while preserving API compatibility.

## Files
- types/openai.go

## Dependencies
- ✅ Issue #2 (Harmony Parser) - COMPLETED

## Progress
- ✅ Extended OpenAIChoice with ThinkingContent and HarmonyChannels fields
- ✅ Extended OpenAIStreamChoice with ThinkingContent and HarmonyChannels fields  
- ✅ Added parser import for claude-proxy/parser
- ✅ All fields are optional with json:",omitempty" tags for backward compatibility
- ✅ Build verification successful - no breaking changes
- ✅ Streaming support maintained for both choice types

## Implementation Details
- Added `ThinkingContent *string` field to both OpenAIChoice and OpenAIStreamChoice
- Added `HarmonyChannels []parser.Channel` field to both OpenAIChoice and OpenAIStreamChoice
- Used pointer type for ThinkingContent to support nil values for empty thinking content
- Used slice type for HarmonyChannels to support multiple channels from Harmony parsing
- All fields marked as omitempty to preserve backward compatibility with existing OpenAI consumers
- Properly integrated parser.Channel types for consistent handling across response types
