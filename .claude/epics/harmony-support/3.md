# Task: Extend Response Types for Thinking Metadata

## Description
Enhance existing response structures in the `types/` package to include thinking content metadata without breaking backward compatibility. This allows the transformation pipeline to preserve thinking/analysis content alongside main responses.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Existing response types extended with thinking metadata fields
- [ ] Backward compatibility maintained (existing code continues to work)
- [ ] New fields for thinking content, channel information, and content classification
- [ ] JSON marshaling/unmarshaling properly handles new fields
- [ ] Type definitions support mixed-channel messages
- [ ] Clear distinction between thinking and response content in type system
- [ ] Unit tests for type marshaling/unmarshaling
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing API contracts

## Technical Details
- **Implementation approach**: Extend existing structs with optional fields using JSON tags
- **Key considerations**: 
  - Must not break existing API consumers
  - Optional fields should have appropriate zero values
  - Support for both single and multiple thinking segments
- **Code locations**: Extend types in `types/` package
- **Key changes**:
  - Add `ThinkingContent []string` field to response types
  - Add `ChannelInfo` metadata struct
  - Add helper methods for thinking content detection

## Dependencies
- [ ] Existing response type definitions in `types/` package
- [ ] JSON marshaling requirements for API compatibility

## Effort Estimate
- Size: S
- Hours: 8-12 hours
- Parallel: true (can run alongside parser development)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented with backward compatibility
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing
- [ ] JSON marshaling tests verify compatibility
- [ ] Documentation updated for new fields
- [ ] No existing functionality broken
