# Task: Comprehensive Testing Suite

## Description
Create comprehensive test coverage for all Harmony parsing functionality including unit tests, integration tests, performance tests, and compatibility tests. This ensures >95% test coverage and validates all edge cases and performance requirements.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Unit tests for parser module covering all format examples from PRD
- [ ] Integration tests for complete request/response transformation cycle
- [ ] Performance tests validating <10ms parsing latency and <5% memory overhead
- [ ] Compatibility tests ensuring no regression in existing format handling
- [ ] Edge case tests for malformed Harmony tokens
- [ ] Streaming response tests
- [ ] Feature flag behavior tests
- [ ] Test coverage >95% for all Harmony-related code
- [ ] Automated performance benchmarks with CI integration

## Technical Details
- **Implementation approach**: Comprehensive test suite using Go testing framework
- **Key considerations**: 
  - Test all format examples from PRD as concrete test cases
  - Performance benchmarks with statistical validation
  - Compatibility matrix testing (Harmony vs Think tags vs Standard)
  - Mock streaming response scenarios
- **Code locations**: 
  - `parser/harmony_test.go`
  - `proxy/transform_test.go` (integration tests)
  - `test/performance/harmony_bench_test.go`
- **Test categories**:
  - Parser unit tests
  - Integration tests
  - Performance benchmarks
  - Edge case validation
  - Compatibility tests

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 001: Parser implementation
- [ ] Task 002: Response type enhancements
- [ ] Task 003: Pipeline integration
- [ ] Task 004: Configuration system
- [ ] Existing test framework and CI/CD pipeline

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 24-30 hours
- Parallel: false (requires all components completed)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All test categories implemented and passing
- [ ] Test coverage reports show >95% coverage
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meet targets
- [ ] CI/CD integration working
- [ ] Edge cases documented and tested
- [ ] Compatibility matrix validated
