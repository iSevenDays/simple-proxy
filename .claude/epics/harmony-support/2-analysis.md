# Issue #2 Work Stream Analysis

## Stream A: Core Parser Types
**Agent**: general-purpose  
**Files**: parser/harmony.go (type definitions and structures)  
**Dependencies**: none  
**Can Start**: immediately  
**Description**: Define HarmonyMessage, Channel, and related data structures. Create the foundational types that other streams will use.

## Stream B: Token Recognition Engine  
**Agent**: general-purpose  
**Files**: parser/harmony.go (regex patterns and token parsing)  
**Dependencies**: Stream A (needs type definitions)  
**Can Start**: after A completes types  
**Description**: Implement regex-based token recognition for <|start|>, <|channel|>, <|message|>, <|end|> patterns with compiled patterns for performance.

## Stream C: Channel Classification Logic  
**Agent**: general-purpose  
**Files**: parser/harmony.go (classification functions)  
**Dependencies**: Stream A (needs types), Stream B (needs token parsing)  
**Can Start**: after A and B  
**Description**: Implement channel classification logic (analysis → thinking, final → response, commentary → tool) and role extraction.

## Stream D: Comprehensive Test Suite  
**Agent**: test-runner  
**Files**: parser/harmony_test.go, test fixtures  
**Dependencies**: none (can use interface-driven development)  
**Can Start**: immediately  
**Description**: Create unit tests, benchmarks, and test coverage for all parser functionality using examples from PRD. Includes performance benchmarks for <5ms target.

## Coordination Notes
- Stream A provides the foundation types that B and C depend on
- Stream D can run in parallel throughout, using interface contracts to test against
- All streams work on the same file (parser/harmony.go) but different sections
- Use clear function/section boundaries to avoid merge conflicts
- Stream D will validate integration as other streams complete

## Recommended Start Order
1. **Immediate Start**: Stream A (types) + Stream D (tests)
2. **After A completes**: Stream B (token parsing)  
3. **After A and B complete**: Stream C (channel classification)

## File Coordination Strategy
Since all implementation streams work on parser/harmony.go:
- Stream A: Top of file (types, constants, structures)
- Stream B: Middle section (token parsing functions) 
- Stream C: Lower section (classification and public API)
- Stream D: Separate test file (parser/harmony_test.go)

## Estimated Timeline
- Stream A: 4-6 hours (types and structure)
- Stream B: 6-8 hours (regex implementation)  
- Stream C: 4-6 hours (classification logic)
- Stream D: 6-8 hours (comprehensive testing)
- **Parallel execution**: ~12-14 hours total vs ~20-24 hours sequential
