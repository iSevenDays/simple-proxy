# Epic: OpenAI Harmony Message Format Support

## Overview

Implement OpenAI Harmony format parsing in Simple Proxy's existing transformation pipeline to distinguish between thinking content (`<|channel|>analysis`) and user responses (`<|channel|>final`). This leverages existing architecture while adding minimal new code through a focused parser module that integrates seamlessly with current `proxy/transform.go` logic.

## Architecture Decisions

### Parser Integration Strategy
- **Extend existing transformation pipeline**: Add Harmony parsing as a pre-processing step in `proxy/transform.go`
- **Reuse response structures**: Extend existing response types to include thinking metadata rather than creating new structures
- **Regex-based parsing**: Use efficient regex patterns for token recognition to minimize performance impact

### Technology Choices
- **Pure Go implementation**: No external dependencies required
- **Streaming-compatible**: Parser works with both complete and chunked responses
- **Feature flag controlled**: `HARMONY_PARSING_ENABLED` allows gradual rollout

### Design Patterns
- **Strategy pattern**: Different parsing strategies for complete vs streaming responses
- **Chain of responsibility**: Parse attempts Harmony → fallback to existing logic
- **Decorator pattern**: Enhance existing response transformation without modification

## Technical Approach

### Backend Services

#### Core Parser Module (`parser/harmony.go`)
- Token recognition using compiled regex patterns
- Channel classification (analysis → thinking, final → response, commentary → tool)
- Graceful degradation for malformed input

#### Response Transformation Integration
- Extend existing `proxy/transform.go` with harmony detection
- Add thinking content metadata to existing response structures
- Preserve all current tool/system override functionality

#### Configuration Enhancement
- Add harmony-specific environment variables to existing config system
- Debug logging integration with current structured logging
- Feature flag support through existing configuration framework

### Infrastructure
- **No deployment changes**: Leverages existing Simple Proxy deployment
- **Backward compatibility**: Zero impact on existing model responses
- **Performance target**: <10ms parsing overhead, <5% memory increase

## Implementation Strategy

### Risk Mitigation
- **Feature flag rollout**: Gradual enablement to test with real traffic
- **Fallback logic**: Always gracefully handle parsing failures
- **Comprehensive testing**: >95% test coverage with extensive edge cases

### Testing Approach
- **Unit tests**: Parser logic with all format examples from PRD
- **Integration tests**: Full request/response cycle with Harmony content
- **Performance tests**: Latency and memory impact validation
- **Compatibility tests**: Ensure no regression in existing formats

## Task Breakdown Preview

High-level task categories that will be created:
- [ ] **Core Parser Implementation**: Harmony token parsing and channel classification
- [ ] **Response Structure Enhancement**: Extend existing types to support thinking metadata
- [ ] **Transformation Pipeline Integration**: Integrate parser into existing transform.go
- [ ] **Configuration System**: Add environment variables and feature flags
- [ ] **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit, integration, and performance tests
- [ ] **Documentation & Examples**: API docs and usage examples

## Dependencies

### External Dependencies
- **OpenAI Harmony specification**: Stable format specification (assumed stable)
- **Claude Code UI**: Existing thinking content rendering support

### Internal Dependencies
- **Existing transformation pipeline**: `proxy/transform.go` (will be extended, not modified)
- **Current response types**: `types/` package (will be enhanced with metadata)
- **Configuration system**: Environment variable and feature flag support
- **Test framework**: Existing Go test infrastructure

### Prerequisite Work
- None - builds entirely on existing Simple Proxy architecture

## Success Criteria (Technical)

### Performance Benchmarks
- **Parsing latency**: <10ms additional processing time
- **Memory overhead**: <5% increase for typical responses
- **Throughput**: No degradation in requests per second

### Quality Gates
- **Test coverage**: >95% for all Harmony parsing components
- **Parsing accuracy**: >99% correct classification of well-formed messages
- **Error handling**: 100% graceful degradation for malformed input
- **Backward compatibility**: Zero regression in existing format handling

### Acceptance Criteria
- Analysis channel content marked as thinking and properly formatted
- Final channel content appears as clean main response
- Commentary channel content handled appropriately for tool calls
- Feature can be enabled/disabled via configuration flag

## Estimated Effort

### Overall Timeline
- **Total effort**: 3-4 weeks for complete implementation
- **MVP delivery**: 2 weeks for core functionality
- **Production ready**: 1 week additional for comprehensive testing

### Resource Requirements
- **Single developer**: Full-time focus on implementation
- **Testing support**: Existing test framework and CI/CD pipeline
- **No additional infrastructure**: Uses current Simple Proxy deployment

### Critical Path Items
1. **Parser implementation** (Week 1): Core Harmony format recognition
2. **Pipeline integration** (Week 2): Seamless integration with existing transform logic
3. **Comprehensive testing** (Week 3): Edge cases, performance, compatibility validation
4. **Documentation & rollout** (Week 4): Production deployment with feature flag
