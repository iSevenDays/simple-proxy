# Issue #4 Work Stream Analysis

## Stream A: Configuration and Feature Flags
**Agent**: general-purpose
**Files**: config/config.go
**Dependencies**: None (can start immediately)
**Can Start**: immediately
**Description**: Add Harmony parsing configuration options and feature flags. Define HARMONY_PARSING_ENABLED environment variable and related configuration structures.

## Stream B: Harmony Detection and Transform Integration
**Agent**: general-purpose  
**Files**: proxy/transform.go
**Dependencies**: Stream A (configuration interface)
**Can Start**: after A defines interface
**Description**: Integrate Harmony format detection into the transformation pipeline. Implement chain-of-responsibility pattern with Harmony parsing as pre-processing step and fallback to existing logic.

## Stream C: Response Building with Thinking Metadata
**Agent**: general-purpose
**Files**: proxy/transform.go (response building functions)
**Dependencies**: Issues #2, #3, Stream A
**Can Start**: after A defines interface
**Description**: Build responses with thinking metadata from parsed Harmony content. Map analysis/final/commentary channels to appropriate response fields using extended types from Issue #3.

## Stream D: Integration Testing
**Agent**: test-runner
**Files**: test/harmony_integration_test.go (new)
**Dependencies**: Streams A, B, C foundational work
**Can Start**: after B+C core functionality
**Description**: End-to-end integration tests verifying Harmony parsing works correctly with existing transformation pipeline, streaming support, and tool/system overrides.

## Coordination Notes
- Stream A provides configuration interface that B and C depend on
- Streams B and C both modify proxy/transform.go - careful coordination needed around file sections
- Stream B handles detection and routing, Stream C handles response construction
- Stream D validates complete integration after core functionality is implemented
- All streams must preserve existing transformation pipeline functionality

## Integration with Issues #2 & #3
- Direct use of completed `parser.ParseHarmonyMessage()`, `parser.IsHarmonyFormat()` functions
- Leverage extended `AnthropicResponse` and `OpenAIChoice` types with thinking metadata fields
- Build on stable parser foundation and response type enhancements
- Chain-of-responsibility pattern allows safe integration without disrupting existing flows

## Recommended Start Order
1. **Immediate Start**: Stream A (Configuration)
2. **After A interface defined**: Stream B (Detection) + Stream C (Response Building) in parallel
3. **After B+C core functionality**: Stream D (Integration Testing)

## File Coordination Strategy
- Stream A: Isolated to config/config.go
- Stream B: Top section of proxy/transform.go (detection and routing)
- Stream C: Middle section of proxy/transform.go (response building)
- Stream D: Separate test file with integration tests

**Estimated Timeline**: 16-20 hours with parallel execution vs 20-24 hours sequential
