# Task: Add Configuration System for Harmony Features

## Description
Extend the existing configuration system to support Harmony-specific settings including feature flags, debug logging, and compatibility modes. This enables controlled rollout and debugging capabilities for the new Harmony parsing functionality.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `HARMONY_PARSING_ENABLED` environment variable (default: true)
- [ ] `HARMONY_DEBUG` environment variable for detailed parsing logs
- [ ] `HARMONY_STRICT_MODE` for error handling behavior configuration
- [ ] Integration with existing configuration loading system
- [ ] Configuration validation and defaults
- [ ] Environment variable documentation in `.env.example`
- [ ] Debug logging integration with existing structured logging
- [ ] Configuration hot-reload support (if existing system supports it)

## Technical Details
- **Implementation approach**: Extend existing configuration system
- **Key considerations**: 
  - Follow existing configuration patterns and conventions
  - Provide sensible defaults
  - Support feature flag-based rollout
  - Debug logging should be structured and filterable
- **Code locations**: Extend configuration in `config/` package
- **Key additions**:
  - New configuration struct fields for Harmony settings
  - Environment variable parsing for new flags
  - Debug logging helper functions

## Dependencies
- [ ] Existing configuration system in `config/` package
- [ ] Existing logging infrastructure

## Effort Estimate
- Size: S
- Hours: 6-8 hours
- Parallel: true (independent of parser implementation)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Configuration fields added and validated
- [ ] Environment variables documented
- [ ] Default values configured appropriately
- [ ] Debug logging implemented and tested
- [ ] Integration with existing config system verified
