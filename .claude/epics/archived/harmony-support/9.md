# Issue #9 - Claude Code UI Displaying Raw Harmony tokens

## Problem Statement

Claude Code UI is displaying raw Harmony tokens instead of processed content. Users see the raw format like `<|channel|>analysis<|message|>...` instead of the properly separated thinking content and final response.

## Analysis

This issue occurs after the Harmony parsing fix (Issue #8) was implemented. While the Simple Proxy is now correctly detecting and processing Harmony content, the Claude Code UI is not receiving the properly formatted response.

**Key Evidence:**
- Simple Proxy logs show successful Harmony processing: "üîç Harmony tokens detected, performing full extraction"
- Channels are being extracted successfully (no longer seeing "no channels extracted" error)
- However, Claude Code UI still displays raw tokens instead of formatted content

## Root Cause Investigation

The issue likely exists in one of these areas:

1. **Response Format**: Simple Proxy may not be converting the processed Harmony content back to the expected Anthropic format
2. **Content Structure**: The response structure may not match what Claude Code UI expects for thinking content display
3. **Metadata Missing**: Required metadata for thinking content may not be included in the response
4. **Tool Call Handling**: If the content involves tool calls, the formatting may be incorrect

## Technical Requirements

1. **Response Format Validation**: Ensure processed Harmony content is converted to proper Anthropic format
2. **Thinking Content Metadata**: Add proper metadata fields that Claude Code UI expects
3. **Content Separation**: Ensure analysis content is marked as thinking and final content as main response
4. **Tool Call Support**: Handle commentary channel for tool calls if applicable

## Success Criteria

- Claude Code UI displays thinking content in collapsible section
- Main response shows only the final channel content
- No raw Harmony tokens visible in the UI
- Existing non-Harmony responses continue to work normally

## Files to Investigate

- `proxy/transform.go` - Response transformation logic
- `types/anthropic.go` - Response structure definitions
- Test files to verify the expected output format

## Test Cases to Add

1. Harmony response with analysis and final channels
2. Harmony response with commentary channel (tool calls)
3. Mixed responses (some Harmony, some not)
4. Malformed Harmony content (should gracefully degrade)

## Implementation Summary

**Root Cause**: The thinking content was being extracted from Harmony messages but never assigned to the `ThinkingContent` field in the `AnthropicResponse` struct, causing Claude Code UI to display raw tokens.

**Solution Implemented**:

1. **TDD Test Added**: `TestTransformOpenAIToAnthropic_HarmonyThinkingContent` in `proxy/transform_test.go`
   - Tests proper extraction and assignment of thinking content from analysis channel
   - Tests main response extraction from final channel
   - Uses official OpenAI Harmony format specification

2. **Transform Logic Enhanced** (`proxy/transform.go`):
   - Added `thinkingContent` and `harmonyChannels` variables
   - Store extracted thinking content: `thinkingContent = harmonyMsg.ThinkingText`
   - Assign to response struct: `ThinkingContent: thinkingContent`
   - Added debug logging for thinking content assignment

3. **Response Structure** (`types/anthropic.go`):
   - Existing `ThinkingContent` and `HarmonyChannels` fields were properly defined
   - No changes needed - infrastructure was already in place

**Files Modified**:
- `proxy/transform.go` - Added thinking content assignment logic
- `proxy/transform_test.go` - Added comprehensive TDD test

**Result**: Claude Code UI now properly displays thinking content from analysis channel in collapsible section, with main response content from final channel displayed normally.
