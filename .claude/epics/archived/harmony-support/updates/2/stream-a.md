# Stream A: Core Parser Types

## Scope
Define HarmonyMessage, Channel, and related data structures. Create the foundational types that other streams will use.

## Files
- parser/harmony.go (type definitions and structures)

## Progress
- ✅ Created parser/harmony.go with core type definitions
- ✅ Defined HarmonyMessage struct with channels, thinking, response, and tool call content
- ✅ Defined Channel struct with type classification and content metadata
- ✅ Implemented Role enumeration (assistant, user, system, developer, tool)
- ✅ Implemented ChannelType enumeration (analysis, final, commentary, unknown)
- ✅ Implemented ContentType enumeration (thinking, response, tool_call, regular)
- ✅ Added comprehensive error types for parsing failures (HarmonyParseError)
- ✅ Created TokenRecognizer struct with compiled regex patterns
- ✅ Added helper functions for role/channel validation and classification
- ✅ Included comprehensive documentation comments for all exported types
- ✅ Added JSON struct tags for proper marshaling
- ✅ Implemented utility methods for content type checking and channel filtering

## Implementation Details
The core parser types provide:

### Key Structures
- **HarmonyMessage**: Main container for parsed Harmony content with multiple channels
- **Channel**: Individual channel with type classification and content
- **TokenRecognizer**: Efficient regex-based token pattern matching
- **HarmonyParseError**: Structured error handling with context

### Channel Type Mapping
- `analysis` → `thinking` (for Claude Code thinking panel)
- `final` → `response` (main user-facing content)  
- `commentary` → `tool_call` (tool-related content)

### Helper Functions
- Role validation and parsing with fallback to assistant
- Channel type classification with unknown fallback
- Content type determination based on channel
- Token pattern compilation and recognition

## Status
**COMPLETED** - All foundational types and structures are implemented and ready for use by Stream B (Token Recognition) and Stream C (Classification).
