# Stream C: Channel Classification Logic

## Scope
Implement the main ParseHarmonyMessage function and channel classification logic that maps harmony channels to Claude Code content types.

## Files
- parser/harmony.go (classification functions and public API - final section)

## Dependencies
- ✅ Stream A (Core Parser Types) - COMPLETED
- ✅ Stream B (Token Recognition Engine) - COMPLETED

## Progress
- ✅ Implemented the critical missing `ParseHarmonyMessage(content string) (*HarmonyMessage, error)` function
- ✅ Added complete channel classification logic:
  - `analysis` channel → `thinking` content type (for Claude Code thinking panel)
  - `final` channel → `response` content type (main user-facing content)  
  - `commentary` channel → `tool_call` content type (tool-related content)
- ✅ Built consolidated text fields by content type (ThinkingText, ResponseText, ToolCallText)
- ✅ Added comprehensive error handling for complex parsing scenarios
- ✅ Implemented support for mixed-channel messages
- ✅ Created helper functions for message construction
- ✅ Added utility functions: FindHarmonyTokens, ValidateHarmonyStructure, GetHarmonyTokenStats
- ✅ Comprehensive test suite covering all PRD examples
- ✅ Performance benchmarks showing <10μs parsing time (well under 5ms target)

## Implementation Details

### Key Functions Implemented
- **`ParseHarmonyMessage()`**: Main API function for parsing Harmony format messages
- **Channel Classification**: Proper mapping from harmony channels to content types
- **Content Consolidation**: Building unified text fields from multiple channels of same type
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of malformed and partial input
- **Performance Optimized**: Using compiled regex patterns with package-level cache

### Channel Type Mapping
The implementation correctly maps harmony channels to Claude Code content types:
- `analysis` → `thinking` (displayed in Claude Code thinking panel)
- `final` → `response` (main user-facing content)
- `commentary` → `tool_call` (tool-related content)
- `unknown` → `regular` (fallback for unrecognized channels)

### Test Coverage
- ✅ All PRD format examples tested and passing
- ✅ Edge cases: empty input, malformed tokens, mixed channels
- ✅ Performance benchmarks: averaging 10μs per parse operation
- ✅ Error handling: graceful degradation for invalid input
- ✅ Real-world examples from PRD tested successfully

### Performance Results
```
BenchmarkParseHarmonyMessage-12    	  122612	     10129 ns/op
```
- Average parsing time: ~10 microseconds
- Well under the 5ms requirement (500x faster than target)
- Efficient regex compilation with package-level caching

## Integration
The parser is now ready for Stream D (Testing Integration) and provides:

1. **Complete API Surface**: All required functions from task acceptance criteria
2. **Channel Classification**: Proper mapping to Claude Code UI expectations  
3. **Error Resilience**: Graceful handling of malformed input
4. **Performance Optimized**: Sub-millisecond parsing times
5. **Comprehensive Testing**: Full test coverage including PRD examples

## Status
**COMPLETED** - Issue #2 core parser implementation is complete. The critical `ParseHarmonyMessage` function and all channel classification logic has been implemented with comprehensive testing. Stream D can now proceed with complete integration testing.
