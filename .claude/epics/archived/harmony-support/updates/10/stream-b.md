# Stream B: Content Structure Analysis

## Scope
Analyze how tool call content differs from regular Harmony responses

## Files  
- Response samples from GitHub issue
- Test data comparison

## Progress
- âœ… Analysis complete
- **Content Structure**: Partial Harmony format without `<|start|>` token
- **Length**: 1,247 characters (longer than typical)
- **Should Work**: Parser supports partial sequences
- **Conclusion**: Content structure is valid, issue is in detection logic
- **Confirms Stream A**: Detection needs to include channel/message tokens
