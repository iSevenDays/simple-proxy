# Stream D: Integration Testing

## Scope
End-to-end integration tests verifying Harmony parsing works correctly with existing transformation pipeline, streaming support, and tool/system overrides.

## Files
- test/harmony_integration_test.go (new)

## Dependencies Status
- ✅ Issues #2, #3 - COMPLETED
- ✅ Stream A (Configuration) - COMPLETED  
- ✅ Stream B (Detection) - COMPLETED (2025-08-27T16:52:00Z)
- ✅ Stream C (Response Building) - COMPLETED (2025-08-27T13:45:00Z)

## Progress
- **Ready to Proceed**: All core functionality complete
- Core Harmony parsing and transformation pipeline fully implemented
- Feature flag control and configuration system in place
- Detection and response building logic completed

## Next Steps
1. Implement comprehensive integration test suite
2. Test end-to-end Harmony parsing workflows
3. Validate feature flag enabled/disabled states
4. Verify backward compatibility with existing formats
5. Test performance targets (<10ms parsing overhead)
