# Execution Status

## Active Agents
- Agent-1: Issue #20 Fix Harmony Channel Extraction Logic (Core Parser) - ✅ ANALYSIS COMPLETE 
- Agent-2: Issue #21 Optimize Harmony Parsing Performance (Performance) - ✅ ANALYSIS COMPLETE
- Agent-3: Issue #22 Enhance Edge Case Handling for Malformed Content (Edge Cases) - ✅ ANALYSIS COMPLETE

## Implementation Ready
All three agents have completed their analysis phase and identified the specific changes needed:

### Issue #20: Core Fix Required
- **Location**: `parser/harmony.go` lines 571, 587, 593
- **Fix**: Update regex patterns to support both `<|end|>` and `<|return|>` tokens
- **Status**: Ready for implementation

### Issue #21: Performance Optimization 
- **Current**: Meets targets (500-600 ns/op)
- **Optimizations**: Memory allocation and string building improvements identified
- **Status**: Optional optimizations documented, targets already met

### Issue #22: Edge Case Handling
- **Enhancement**: Robust parsing functions for malformed content
- **Fallback**: Graceful degradation mechanisms designed  
- **Status**: Implementation plan complete

## Next Steps
1. Implement the core regex fix (#20) - This will solve the main bug
2. Validate with TDD tests - Tests should pass after core fix
3. Optional: Apply performance optimizations (#21)
4. Optional: Enhance edge case handling (#22)

## Key Insight
The main issue is simple: regex patterns only support `<|end|>` but content uses `<|return|>` tokens. This single fix should resolve the primary bug where raw tokens appear instead of extracted content.
