# Stream C: Performance Benchmarks

## Scope
Implement `BenchmarkHarmonyParsing` function, create benchmarks for small, medium, and large content, measure parsing overhead and memory allocation, establish baseline performance metrics.

## Files
- `test/newline_formatting_test.go`

## Progress
- ✅ COMPLETED: `BenchmarkHarmonyParsing` function with size variations
- ✅ COMPLETED: Performance benchmarks for small, medium, and large content
- ✅ COMPLETED: Memory allocation tracking and parsing overhead measurement
- ✅ COMPLETED: Baseline performance metrics established (<10ms for small, <50ms for large)
- ✅ COMPLETED: Performance validation with target compliance testing

## Key Deliverables
- Complete performance benchmark suite with memory tracking
- Size-based performance validation (small/medium/large content)
- Parsing overhead measurement and baseline establishment
- Memory allocation analysis for optimization insights
