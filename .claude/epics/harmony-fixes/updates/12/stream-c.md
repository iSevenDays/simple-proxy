# Stream C: Specification Comparison and Final Synthesis

## Scope
Research official OpenAI Harmony format specification, compare with current implementation, synthesize all findings into actionable root cause analysis and comprehensive final report.

## Progress
- ✅ COMPLETED: Reviewed Stream A and Stream B completed analysis
- ✅ COMPLETED: Researched OpenAI Harmony format specification via web search and documentation
- ✅ COMPLETED: Analyzed specification vs implementation gaps
- ✅ COMPLETED: Created comprehensive analysis report (12-analysis-report.md)
- ✅ COMPLETED: Documented pattern behaviors (current vs specification)
- ✅ COMPLETED: Provided actionable recommendations with implementation timeline

## Key Findings

### OpenAI Harmony Specification Requirements
- **Channel Structure**: `<|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>CONTENT<|return|>`
- **Content Location**: Within channel message blocks, not after complete sequences
- **Channel Priorities**: `final` channel contains user-facing content, `analysis` for thinking
- **Termination Tokens**: `<|return|>` for completion, `<|end|>` for storage/history

### Root Cause Identified
**Content Source Priority Inversion**: Implementation incorrectly prioritizes cleanup logic over properly parsed channel content. The fix requires simple logic reordering in `proxy/transform.go:688-700`.

### Critical Implementation Gap
Current logic assumes useful content exists **after** Harmony sequences, but specification defines content exists **within** channel message blocks that the parser already extracts correctly.

## Synthesis Outcome
Created comprehensive analysis report providing:
1. Complete root cause analysis
2. Specific line-by-line fix recommendations
3. Implementation timeline and impact assessment
4. Full specification compliance documentation

## Deliverables
- **12-analysis-report.md**: Complete analysis synthesis (18 sections, 200+ lines)
- **Pattern Documentation**: Current vs specification behavior comparison
- **Actionable Recommendations**: Immediate fix with code examples
- **Implementation Timeline**: Phased approach with risk assessment
