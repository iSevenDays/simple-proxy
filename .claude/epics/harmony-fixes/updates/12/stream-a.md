# Stream A: Code Structure Analysis

## Scope
Map current Harmony parsing flow and architecture, identify all functions involved in content extraction, document current regex patterns and extraction methods, and trace data flow through parsing pipeline.

## Files
- `proxy/transform.go` (lines 650-720)
- `parser/harmony.go`
- `test/newline_formatting_test.go`

## Progress
- ✅ COMPLETED: Full code structure analysis 
- ✅ Found critical content extraction failure in transform.go lines 688-700
- ✅ Documented complete logic trace and architecture overview
- ✅ Identified root cause in dual-source content selection logic

## Key Findings
- **Critical Issue**: Content extraction logic fails in transform.go:688-700
- **Architecture**: Complete flow mapped from IsHarmonyFormat() through content extraction
- **Root Cause**: Raw tokens appear due to dual content source selection failures
- **Regex Patterns**: Documented current patterns and limitations
