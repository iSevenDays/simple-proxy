# Stream B: Failure Point Investigation

## Scope
Run and analyze failing TDD test, identify exact line numbers where extraction fails, document what should happen vs what actually happens, and trace through specific failure scenarios.

## Files
- `proxy/transform.go` (focus on extraction logic)
- `test/newline_formatting_test.go` (test failure analysis)

## Progress
- ✅ COMPLETED: Comprehensive failure point analysis
- ✅ Identified specific line-level failures in content extraction
- ✅ Mapped execution paths that lead to raw token output
- ✅ Documented what should happen vs actual behavior

## Key Findings
- **Critical Lines**: 675-679 (token position), 682-684 (boundaries), 688-695 (selection logic)
- **Root Cause**: Mismatch between parser capabilities and integration logic
- **Primary Risk**: Content boundary detection assumes content after `<|end|>` token
- **Impact**: Raw structural tokens contaminate output instead of clean content
